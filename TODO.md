## Hardening Checklist For Publication (Actionable, Specific)

This list aligns the repo with what‚Äôs actually implemented, fixes correctness issues, and gets you a polished, credible portfolio artifact. Each item is scoped and testable.

1) Monte Carlo correctness and variance reduction
- Clamp Box‚ÄìMuller to avoid log(0):
  - File: `src/core/montecarlo.js`
  - Change inside `SimpleRNG.normal()`:
    ```js
    // Before
    const u = this.random();
    const v = this.random();
    // After (clamp u away from 0)
    const u = Math.max(1e-12, this.random());
    const v = Math.max(1e-12, this.random());
    ```
- Replace antithetic path hack with paired simulation per step (no reliance on lastNormals):
  - Replace current antithetic usage with a paired simulator:
    ```js
    function simulatePairedPaths(initialPrice, drift, diffusion, timeSteps, rng) {
      let p1 = initialPrice, p2 = initialPrice;
      for (let t = 0; t < timeSteps; t++) {
        const z = rng.normal();
        p1 *= Math.exp(drift + diffusion * z);
        p2 *= Math.exp(drift - diffusion * z); // antithetic
      }
      return [p1, p2];
    }
    // In the main loop
    const [pA, pB] = simulatePairedPaths(stockPrice, drift, diffusion, timeSteps, rng);
    payoffs.push(calculatePayoff(pA, strikePrice, optionType));
    if (useAntithetic) payoffs.push(calculatePayoff(pB, strikePrice, optionType));
    ```
- Implement a real control variate (terminal price as control, known expectation):
  - Replace `calculateControlVariatePayoff` and `applyControlVariate` to use `discountFactor * S_T` as control with known mean `S0 * exp(-qT)`:
    ```js
    // Replace calculateControlVariatePayoff
    function calculateControlVariatePayoff(stockPriceT, { stockPrice, dividendYield = 0, timeToExpiry, riskFreeRate }) {
      // Control variable C = e^{-rT} S_T, E[C] = S0 e^{-qT}
      const discountFactor = Math.exp(-riskFreeRate * timeToExpiry);
      return discountFactor * stockPriceT;
    }

    function applyControlVariate(payoffs, controlPayoffs, params) {
      const n = payoffs.length;
      const meanX = payoffs.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0)/n;
      const meanC = controlPayoffs.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0)/n;
      let cov = 0, varC = 0;
      for (let i=0;i<n;i++){ const dx=payoffs[i]-meanX, dc=controlPayoffs[i]-meanC; cov+=dx*dc; varC+=dc*dc; }
      cov/= (n-1); varC/= (n-1);
      const beta = varC>0 ? cov/varC : 0;
      // Known E[C] = S0 * e^{-qT}
      const expectedC = params.stockPrice * Math.exp(-(params.dividendYield||0) * params.timeToExpiry);
      const adjMean = meanX - beta * (meanC - expectedC);
      // Variance of adjusted estimator
      const varX = payoffs.reduce((s,p)=>s+(p-meanX)**2,0)/(n-1);
      const corr2 = varC>0 && varX>0 ? (cov*cov)/(varX*varC) : 0;
      const adjVar = (varX * (1 - Math.min(1, Math.max(0, corr2)))) / n;
      return { price: adjMean, variance: adjVar };
    }
    ```
  - Note: We no longer multiply by `discountFactor` again in `applyControlVariate` because both X and C are already discounted.
- Fix adaptive Monte Carlo to accumulate across batches (Œ£X, Œ£X¬≤, n):
  - Replace `adaptiveMonteCarloPrice` loop with accumulation:
    ```js
    export function adaptiveMonteCarloPrice(params, targetError=0.01, maxSimulations=1_000_000, batchSize=10_000){
      let n=0, sum=0, sumsq=0;
      const seed0 = params.seed || Math.floor(Math.random()*1e9);
      while(n < maxSimulations){
        const batch = monteBatch(params, batchSize, seed0 + n); // implement to return array of discounted payoffs
        for (const x of batch){ n++; sum+=x; sumsq+=x*x; }
        const mean = sum/n; const varHat = Math.max(0, (sumsq/n) - mean*mean);
        const se = Math.sqrt(varHat/n);
        if (se <= targetError) return { price: mean, standardError: se, confidenceInterval: { lower: mean-1.96*se, upper: mean+1.96*se, width: 3.92*se }, statistics: { simulations: n, variance: varHat, useAntithetic: !!params.useAntithetic, useControlVariate: !!params.useControlVariate, convergenceRate: (se*Math.sqrt(n)), efficiency: varHat>0 ? 1/(se*se) : 0 }, converged: true, totalSimulations: n, targetError };
      }
      const mean = sum/n; const varHat = Math.max(0, (sumsq/n) - mean*mean); const se = Math.sqrt(varHat/n);
      return { price: mean, standardError: se, confidenceInterval: { lower: mean-1.96*se, upper: mean+1.96*se, width: 3.92*se }, statistics: { simulations: n, variance: varHat, useAntithetic: !!params.useAntithetic, useControlVariate: !!params.useControlVariate, convergenceRate: (se*Math.sqrt(n)), efficiency: varHat>0 ? 1/(se*se) : 0 }, converged: false, totalSimulations: n, targetError };
    }
    ```

2) Align README/docs with reality (truth changes)
- File: `README.md`
  - Replace ‚ÄúNewton‚ÄìRaphson IV‚Äù with ‚ÄúBisection IV‚Äù in features and API docs.
  - Replace ‚Äú44 unit tests‚Äù with ‚Äúunit tests using Node‚Äôs test runner‚Äù.
  - Rephrase ‚Äú671K real options validation‚Äù to ‚Äúvalidation scaffolding with sample dataset; full dataset available via download‚Äù.
  - Add a short ‚ÄúCredibility & Limitations‚Äù section stating which features are illustrative (jump defaults not calibrated, MC CV is basic, etc.).
- File: `docs/MODEL_ACCURACY_REPORT.md`
  - Add a banner note: ‚ÄúIllustrative report; scripts to reproduce are planned.‚Äù

3) Repo hygiene and size
- Move `market-data-clean.json` out of the repo or into Git LFS; keep a 100‚Äërow sample:
  - Add `.gitattributes`:
    ```gitattributes
    market-data-clean.json filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
    ```
  - Or add to `.gitignore` and commit a smaller `market-data-sample.json` for examples.
- Remove/retire legacy CJS files referencing `index_fixed.js`/`binomial-options.js` or migrate them to import from `lib/index.js`. For example, change in `tests/validate-real-market.cjs`:
  ```js
  // Before
  const BinomialOptions = require('./binomial-options.js');
  // After (use current library via dynamic import)
  const { binomialPrice, calculateGreeks } = await import('../lib/index.js');
  ```
- Package scripts: `package.json` references `scripts/generate-docs.js` (missing). Either add the script or remove the command to avoid broken scripts.

4) API and behavior consistency
- `Option.summary()` should compute `timeValue` from the recommended displayed price (pick Trinomial 50 steps) and memoize repeated prices:
  - File: `src/models/option.js`
  - Suggested change inside `summary()`:
    ```js
    const priceTri = this.trinomialPrice();
    const intrinsic = this.intrinsicValue();
    return {
      // ...
      pricing: {
        binomial: this.binomialPrice(),
        trinomial: priceTri,
        blackScholes: this.blackScholesPrice(),
        jumpDiffusion: this.jumpDiffusionPrice(),
        monteCarlo: this.monteCarloPrice({ simulations: 50000 }).price,
        intrinsic,
        timeValue: priceTri - intrinsic
      },
      // ...
    };
    ```
- Binomial risk‚Äëneutral probability error message: include parameter snapshot to ease debugging:
  - File: `src/core/binomial.js`
  - Replace throw with:
    ```js
    if (p < 0 || p > 1) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid risk-neutral probability p=${p.toFixed(6)} with dt=${dt.toExponential()}, u=${u.toFixed(6)}, d=${d.toFixed(6)}. Check (r‚àíq), œÉ, or steps.`);
    }
    ```

5) Types and name mismatches
- `DividendCategory` type vs. implementation uses `'reits'` (plural) in `getDividendsByCategory`:
  - File: `lib/index.d.ts`
  - Change:
    ```ts
    export type DividendCategory = 'tech' | 'finance' | 'healthcare' | 'consumer' | 'industrial' | 'reit' | 'utilities' | 'energy';
    ```
    to
    ```ts
    export type DividendCategory = 'tech' | 'finance' | 'healthcare' | 'consumer' | 'industrial' | 'reits' | 'utilities' | 'energy';
    ```
  - Alternatively, update `src/utils/dividends.js` to accept `'reit'` and map to `'reits'` internally. Pick one and keep docs/types in sync.

6) Tests you can add to prove fixes
- MC SE reduction: run MC with/without control variate on the same seed and assert `SE_CV < SE_plain` by a factor (e.g., < 0.9x) for ATM call.
- Adaptive MC accumulation: generate price with `targetError=0.01` and assert `converged===true` and `statistics.simulations` increases across batches.
- BS regression values: add 3‚Äì5 known analytical prices and assert within 1e‚Äë4.
- Jump diffusion Œª‚Üí0: assert JD price ‚âà BS price within a small tolerance.
- Types: compile a tiny TS file importing `DividendCategory` and `getDividendsByCategory('reits')` to ensure no type error.

7) README ‚ÄúCredibility‚Äù block (add near the top)
- Suggested text:
  ```md
  Note on Scope & Validation
  This repo is an educational toolkit with working implementations of five models. Some documentation examples and reports are illustrative; validation scripts are provided on a small sample dataset. Monte Carlo control variate is basic and intended for demonstration, not production calibration.
  ```

8) Publish‚Äëready demo page (single, tight scope)
- Ship one SPA page under `public/` that:
  - Accepts S, K, T(days), r, œÉ, q, type, style
  - Shows Trinomial and Black‚ÄìScholes prices + Greeks
  - Displays a payoff chart
  - Includes a ‚Äústeps‚Äù slider (25/50/100) and a small ‚Äúmodel agreement‚Äù indicator (|Tri ‚àí BS|)
- Keep it dependency‚Äëlight (Chart.js is fine). Link to it from README.

---

Completion criteria: each bullet above either changes specific lines in the files named or adds tests/samples that make the change verifiable. Prioritize (1) MC fixes, (2) README truth alignment, (3) repo size hygiene, then (4) types/tests, (5) the demo page.
