# Binomial Project — Candid Technical Review and Path Forward

This is a frank, practitioner‑level review of the repo as it stands: what’s strong, what’s risky, what reads as marketecture vs. implementation, and how to shape this into a polished portfolio piece you can be proud to publish.

## Executive Summary

- Strength: Solid, readable core implementations for binomial, trinomial, Black–Scholes; a coherent `Option` API; light TypeScript type coverage; a comprehensive single‑file test suite; useful examples.
- Risk: Over‑promising in README/docs (claims of 671k option validations, “44 tests,” Newton–Raphson IV, advanced MC variance reduction) that aren’t fully backed by code. Frontend is scaffolded but empty. A 468MB data file in repo. Some legacy/unused CJS scripts.
- Verdict: This is a good educational quant library with ambitious aspirations. It’s not production‑hardened research and not yet a finished “platform.” With a scoped narrative and a few surgical fixes, it can credibly demo “what AI can build with you” without embarrassment.

## What’s Working Well

- Core pricing models:
  - Black–Scholes: Clean, standard implementation with dividend yield; analytical Greeks present. Normal CDF uses A&S approximation (fine for edu/portfolio use).
  - Binomial (CRR): Straightforward, validates inputs, supports American exercise. Sensible defaults and guardrails on parameters.
  - Trinomial: Implements a common drift/probabilities scheme; backward induction with American/European styles; input validation. Nice to see this included.
- Numerical Greeks: Consistent finite‑difference patterns across models; per‑day theta and per‑point vega/rho conventions are clear and documented.
- Option model abstraction: `Option` class composes models cleanly and exposes a pragmatic API (pricing, Greeks, summary), with day‑count handling and dividend lookup.
- Tests and examples: `tests/unit.test.js` covers sanity checks across the API; examples demonstrate convergence/comparison and model intuition. Good pedagogical value.
- Types: `.d.ts` files for core modules and `lib/index.d.ts` give consumers usable IntelliSense and guardrails.

## Key Concerns (Where It Overreaches)

- Monte Carlo variance reduction claims aren’t realized:
  - “Control variate” is a no‑op: `calculateControlVariatePayoff` returns the same payoff, and `theoreticalControlMean` is set to the sample mean. This yields no variance reduction, despite claims and code path implying it.
  - Antithetic sampling is improvised: pulling “last normals” and negating them is brittle and may not pair samples correctly across steps/batches; also Box–Muller uses `u` that can be 0.
  - Adaptive MC doesn’t accumulate: `adaptiveMonteCarloPrice` runs batches but does not aggregate payoffs/variance; it stops when one batch’s SE is small, which is not statistically correct.

- Documentation and README overstate verification:
  - “44 unit tests” vs. a single, large test file. The tests are decent, but the claim is misleading.
  - “Newton–Raphson IV” is claimed; code uses a bisection method in `src/utils/greeks.js`.
  - “671k real options validation” is described, but the path in `tests/validate-real-market.cjs` uses `market-data-clean.json` and an external `binomial-options.js`/`index_fixed.js` pattern; not integrated with the current ESM library.
  - The model accuracy report reads like a whitepaper; it’s fine as aspiration, but the codebase doesn’t include reproducible scripts that compute those exact numbers.

- Repo hygiene and consistency:
  - 468MB `market-data-clean.json` living at repo root is a red flag for any portfolio site; it balloons clone times and hurts credibility. This belongs in LFS or as a download step.
  - Mixed module systems: Most of the library is ESM; a few validation/legacy tools are CJS (`validator.js` with `require('./index_fixed.js')`). This will confuse consumers.
  - UI scaffolding is empty: `src/components/*` and `src/pages/*` folders contain no actual components/pages yet, while README pitches an interactive platform.

## Technical Review Notes (By Area)

- Black–Scholes (`src/core/blackscholes.js`)
  - d1/d2 and dividend discounting look correct. Greeks use expected forms; theta is per‑day, vega/rho per‑percentage‑point, which is clearly communicated. normalCDF A&S is acceptable here.
  - Suggest: optionally provide `erf` fallback when available; note units explicitly in return object.

- Binomial (`src/core/binomial.js`)
  - CRR parameters and risk‑neutral probability `p` are standard; throws if `p∉[0,1]`. Early exercise for American handled via intrinsic vs. continuation.
  - Suggest: surface the reason `p` is out of bounds (dt too large, σ too small, r−q extreme). Also consider an alternative parametrization (Jarrow–Rudd) for edge cases.

- Trinomial (`src/core/trinomial.js`)
  - Probabilities `pu,pd,pm` derived from `nu` and `dxu`; validation present. Backward induction aligns with common references.
  - Suggest: document the exact scheme (e.g., Boyle or Kamrad–Ritchken variant) and add a few numeric regression tests vs. BS for European to lock accuracy claims.

- Monte Carlo (`src/core/montecarlo.js`)
  - Issues detailed above. Also, Box–Muller uses `u = rng.random()` without guarding against 0; consider clamping to `(ε,1)`.
  - Suggest: if you don’t have time to implement proper CV, either remove it or implement a standard control variate (e.g., use the analytical BS price as the control with known expectation) and aggregate batches correctly in the adaptive variant.

- Jump Diffusion (`src/core/jumpdiffusion.js`)
  - Series expansion structure is fine; convergence guard present. Parameter defaults per asset class are pedagogically useful, but make it explicit they’re illustrative, not calibrated.
  - Suggest: expose a way to return n‑term partials and convergence diagnostics for demos; add simple sanity tests vs. BS when `λ→0` and small jumps.

- Option API (`src/models/option.js`)
  - Thoughtful composition; pragmatic defaults for `r` and day count; dividend lookup is a nice touch. `summary()` gives a good one‑shot demo payload.
  - Suggest: memoize repeated calculations inside `summary()` (you re‑price multiple models); fix `timeValue` to be consistent with the “recommended” model you promote.

- Types and packaging (`lib/index.js`, `lib/index.d.ts`, package.json)
  - ESM packaging is modern; types are helpful. Export surface is coherent.
  - Suggest: ensure the tests/examples import from `lib/` consistently (no `index_fixed.js` references). Consider publishing as a scoped package with a minimal file set.

- Tests and examples (`tests/*`, `examples/*`)
  - Unit tests cover many sanity checks and API invariants; examples are pedagogically sound (convergence tables, model comparisons).
  - Suggest: split unit tests into smaller files by domain; add a few deterministic regression values (e.g., known BS prices) to complement property‑style tests.

## Product & Narrative Review

- Tone: The README/Docs are aspirational and read like a polished product landing page. That’s attractive for a portfolio, but it creates a trust gap when the repo contains empty UI directories and some unimplemented claims.
- Positioning: This would shine as “an AI‑assisted educational quant toolkit and demo,” not “a fully validated production platform.” You can still highlight ambition—just add footnotes/links to code paths or caveats.
- UX: No actual frontend yet. For a portfolio, a single exceptional page beats a sprawling unfinished site. Focus on 1–2 tight, delightful visualizations.

## Priority Fixes Before Publishing

1) Reconcile claims with code
- Change README to state “Bisection IV solver” (or implement Newton–Raphson correctly with a Vega guard and bracketing).
- Remove or rephrase “control variate” and “adaptive MC” until they’re implemented properly.
- Tidy “44 tests” to “unit tests with Node’s test runner” unless you break them out.

2) Fix Monte Carlo module (or scope it down)
- Implement true control variate using analytical BS with known expectation; compute β via covariance and correct theoretical mean; show SE reduction vs. baseline in an example.
- Fix adaptive batching to accumulate ΣX and ΣX² across batches, recomputing mean/SE globally; stop on target SE.
- Guard Box–Muller: clamp `u = max(u, 1e-12)`.

3) Trim and tidy the repo
- Move `market-data-clean.json` out of the repo (LFS or downloadable asset); keep a 100‑row sample for examples.
- Remove/relocate legacy CJS files referencing `index_fixed.js` or wire them to the current ESM API behind a `legacy/` folder disclaimer.
- Add a `scripts/` folder with any reproducible analysis that backs report claims, or prune the claims.

4) Ship one polished demo page
- A single page app (pure JS + minimal UI or a tiny React app) that:
  - Inputs: S, K, T (days), r, σ, q, type, style
  - Outputs: price(s) from 2 models (Trinomial and BS), Greeks, payoff diagram
  - Extra: small “convergence dial” (steps 25/50/100) and a “model agreement bar”
  - Visual: clean, mobile‑friendly, light/dark theme, zero dependencies beyond a light chart lib

5) Add a “Credibility” section to README
- Briefly explain what is validated vs. illustrative and link to example scripts that regenerate any tables/figures.

## Suggested Roadmap (Lean and Credible)

- Week 1: Hygiene & truth‑alignment
  - Update README to match reality; prune over‑claims; add “What’s implemented vs. planned.”
  - Remove large data, move legacy scripts, standardize on ESM. Add a small reproducible dataset and a script to run a tiny validation sample.

- Week 2: MC correctness or downscope
  - Either remove MC variance‑reduction features or implement them properly:
    - Proper control variate with analytical expectation
    - Accumulating adaptive MC
    - Add one example showing SE reduction and batch convergence

- Week 3: Portfolio demo page
  - Build a single‑page interactive calculator with a payoff chart and Greeks dashboard; deploy statically; link in README.
  - Optional: a second “Algorithm Explorer” (animated trinomial backward induction for 10 steps with time scrubber).

- Week 4: Reproducibility & polish
  - Provide 2–3 scripts to regenerate tables/plots in docs (convergence table, accuracy vs. steps, etc.).
  - Split tests, add a few numeric regression tests (known BS prices and a binomial European match within tolerance).

## Small, High‑Impact Code Tweaks

- Monte Carlo
  - Clamp Box–Muller: `const u = Math.max(1e-12, this.random());`
  - If keeping antithetic: generate pairs per step explicitly rather than reading “last normals.”
  - If keeping control variate: use BS analytical as control with known E[control]; compute β and adjust mean properly.
  - Adaptive: keep running sums (ΣX, ΣX², n) across batches; recompute SE = sqrt((ΣX²/n − (ΣX/n)²)/n).

- API consistency
  - Make `Option.summary()` pick one “recommended” price (e.g., Trinomial 50 steps) for `timeValue` calculation and explain it in README.
  - Ensure Greeks units are explicit in docstrings and README (per day, per 1 vol point, per 1 rate point).

- Docs
  - Replace “Newton–Raphson IV” with “Bisection IV” unless NR is implemented.
  - Add a small “Assumptions & Limitations” section (American handling, dividends, bounds on parameters, numerical caveats).

## How To Pitch This (Portfolio‑Ready)

- Title: “AI‑assisted options pricing toolkit: 5 models, tests, and an interactive demo”
- Subhead: “From Black–Scholes to trinomial, with clean APIs and a focused, delightful calculator.”
- Bullets (true today):
  - Implements Black–Scholes, Binomial, Trinomial, Jump Diffusion, and Monte Carlo (baseline)
  - Analytical Greeks for BS; numerical Greeks elsewhere
  - ESM package with type definitions and unit tests
  - Reproducible convergence examples and a tiny real‑market sample validator
- Optional “What’s next”: proper MC variance reduction, full validation pipeline, strategy builder.

## Bottom Line

This codebase is a strong foundation for an educational quant library and a showcase of rapid AI‑assisted development. Tighten the truth in the docs, fix or prune the wobbly MC features, remove heavyweight data, and ship one excellent demo page. Presented that way, it will look sharp, honest, and genuinely useful—exactly the kind of artifact that wins consulting work.
