   } catch (error) {
       price = binomialPrice(params);
   }
   ```

2. **Error Checking**
   ```javascript
   const prices = [
       trinomialPrice(params),
       binomialPrice(params)
   ];
   const avgPrice = prices.reduce((a,b) => a+b) / prices.length;
   const maxDeviation = Math.max(...prices.map(p => Math.abs(p - avgPrice)));
   
   if (maxDeviation > 0.05) {
       console.warn('Large model disagreement detected');
   }
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache frequently-used calculations
   - Use appropriate step counts for accuracy requirements
   - Consider parallel processing for portfolio calculations
   - Implement adaptive step sizing based on option characteristics

### Model Validation

   - Compare trinomial vs binomial prices for sample options
   - Alert if differences exceed 2% for any option
   - Validate American exercise boundaries for ITM options

2. **Weekly Analysis**
   - Monte Carlo validation with confidence intervals
   - Jump diffusion comparison for stress scenarios
   - Performance benchmarking across models

3. **Monthly Review**
